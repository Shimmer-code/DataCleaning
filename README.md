对纳什维尔住房数据进行了全面的清洗和标准化处理，包括转换销售日期格式、填充缺失的房产地址、将复合地址字段拆分为多个标准化列(地址、城市、州)、统一"SoldAsVacant"字段的值为"Yes/No"格式、识别并删除重复记录，以及计划删除冗余列。代码中使用了多种字符串处理函数(SUBSTRING、CHARINDEX、PARSENAME)和数据转换技术，通过创建新列存储拆分后的数据而非直接修改原字段，确保了数据清洗过程的安全性和可追溯性，最终使数据集更加规范化和易于分析。

Performed comprehensive cleaning and standardization on the Nashville housing dataset, including converting sale date formats, filling in missing property addresses, splitting compound address fields into standardized columns (address, city, state), unifying the "SoldAsVacant" field into consistent "Yes/No" values, identifying and removing duplicate records, and planning to drop redundant columns. The code utilized various string manipulation functions (such as SUBSTRING, CHARINDEX, and PARSENAME) and data transformation techniques. New columns were created to store split data instead of overwriting original fields, ensuring safety and traceability throughout the cleaning process. At the end, the dataset became more structured and easier to analyze.
